##Diver:  Dynamic Interactive Views For Reverse Engineering

(This README will be expanded over the next few hours / days.)

Diver is a set of advanced tools for debugging and reverse engineering. If you ever wondered, "What did my program just do?", Diver will help you find the answer.  Diver is a set of Eclipse plugins that aid developers in understanding software. It uses dynamic analysis and reverse engineering to offer views and filters that aid comprehension and discovery.

Diver allows you to:

* Easily trace your Java programs
* Visualize your program's runtime functionality
* Filter your IDE based on what occurs at runtime
* See what code ran in your source code editors
* And generally understand your software better

###Requirements:

In order to run, Diver needs:

* Eclipse 3.7, 32-bit
* A 32-bit Java install
* Windows 7 or Linux.
